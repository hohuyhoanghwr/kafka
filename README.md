# Real-Time IoT Sensor Stream Processing with Apache Kafka

This project implements a real-time stream processing system for simulated IoT temperature sensor data using **Apache Kafka**, **Quix Streams**, and **Streamlit**.

It is based on the exercise specification in `kafka_Roland.md`, extended with advanced features such as:
- Windowed aggregation for **alert counts** and **average temperature**
- A responsive **Streamlit dashboard** for live monitoring

---

## ðŸ”§ System Architecture

The system is composed of 5 main components:

1. **Producer** (`producer.py`)  
   Simulates temperature readings from a device every second and sends them to Kafka (`sensor` topic).

2. **Consumer (Alert Filter)** (`consumer.py`)  
   Reads messages from `sensor`, transforms them, filters for high temperatures (Kelvin > 303), and writes alerts to the `alert` topic.

3. **Alert Counter** (`alert_counter.py`)  
   Consumes from `alert`, performs a hopping window aggregation (5s), and writes count results to the `alert-count` topic.

4. **Average Temperature Tracker** (`avg_temp.py`)  
   Consumes from `sensor`, computes the average temperature in a hopping window (10s), and sends it to the `avg-temp` topic.

5. **Real-Time Dashboard** (`dashboard.py`)  
   Streamlit app that visualizes:
   - Latest temperature per device
   - Average temperature (10s window)
   - Alert count (5s window)
   - A rolling chart of last 100 seconds

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Set up Kafka (Docker)
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Start Consumers  
*(in separate terminals)*
```bash
python consumer.py       # Transforms + filters alerts
python alert_counter.py  # Windowed alert count
python avg_temp.py       # Windowed average temperature
```

### 3. Start Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

âœ… *See screenshot files for the snapshot of the dashboard.*

## ðŸ“Š Kafka Topics Used

| Topic        | Description                                |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `sensor`     | Raw simulated temperature data             |
| `alert`      | Filtered messages with high temperature    |
| `alert-count`| Count of alerts in the last 5 seconds      |
| `avg-temp`   | Average temperature in the last 10 seconds |

---

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

Install via [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):
```bash
uv init
uv add streamlit quixstreams
```

Or use `requirements.in` + `requirements.txt`.

## ðŸ§  Design Concepts

- **StreamingDataFrame (Quix)**: enables declarative pipelines for real-time stream transformations.
- **Windowed Aggregations**: hopping windows for time-based KPIs (e.g. alert counts, temperature averages).
- **Streamlit Layout**: metrics aligned using `st.columns()` for clarity and real-time updates.
